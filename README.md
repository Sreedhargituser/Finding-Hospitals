# Finding-Hospitals


This is a project that I made for my hackathon in the training period. here I am going to find the hospitals avilable in the city and has desired features like having a parking facility and the hospital is open 24X7 etc. 
In this project no additional too like maven is used. Only the plain java and the required jars are added manually.
I guess these changes will be showed in the jenkins
